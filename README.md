Cleaning strings is no easy task, but it’s important, necessary work. From basic find-and-replace operations to more complex regular expressions, this course provides an overview of how to clean strings with pandas 2.0, the latest release of the open-source library for the Python programming language.

Gather insights from University of Notre Dame professor Seth Berry as he explores the fundamentals of string cleaning using pandas expressions, functions, operations, and methods, including PyArrow backends, regular expressions to find and replace text for complex patterns, speed tests, text extractions, match and split functions, quantifiers, backreferences, lookarounds, boundaries, chains, and more. By the end of this course, you’ll be ready to leverage a wide variety of pandas solutions to start cleaning strings on your own.
